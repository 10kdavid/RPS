# Quick Deploy Fix

We've fixed the wallet adapter error by removing the unavailable adapters.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix wallet adapter compatibility error"
git push
```

2. **Verify Deployment on Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your Rock Paper Solana project
   - Check the "Deployments" tab to see if a new deployment is in progress
   - It should show "Building" status for the latest commit

3. **If No Automatic Deployment Is Happening**:
   - Click the "Deployments" tab in your project
   - Click the "Deploy" button (usually in the top-right)
   - Select "Deploy" from the dropdown menu

4. **After Deployment Completes**:
   - Visit your Vercel app URL
   - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to force reload
   - Try connecting your wallet - it should work now!

## Verifying Success

1. The wallet connect button should work when clicked
2. After connecting, your SOL balance should display correctly
3. The wallet dropdown menu should appear when clicking on your balance
