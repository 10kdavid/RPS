# Multiplayer and Game Links Fix

We've fixed the multiplayer functionality and game links in your Rock Paper Solana application. Here's what was done:

## What Was Fixed

1. **Firebase Implementation**
   - Added better error handling and detailed logging to the Firebase functions
   - Fixed the joinGameSession function to properly handle errors
   - Added functionality to verify game existence before attempting to join
   - Enhanced listenToGameUpdates to provide better error feedback

2. **Game Link Handling**
   - Updated how game IDs and invite codes are extracted from URLs
   - Added proper error handling when joining games
   - Fixed the flow for joining games when links are clicked
   - Added checks to ensure users are connected to wallets before joining

3. **Connection Security**
   - Updated Content Security Policy to allow all necessary Firebase connections
   - Added Firebase environment variables to Vercel configuration
   - Fixed CORS issues that were preventing Firebase connections

4. **State Management**
   - Improved logging to track game state changes
   - Fixed issues with player turns not being properly tracked
   - Added better cleanup for Firebase listeners

## Deployment Instructions

1. **Push all changes to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix multiplayer functionality and game links"
git push
```

2. **Verify Deployment in Vercel**:
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard
   - Check that a new deployment is in progress with these changes
   - Or manually trigger a new deployment

3. **After Deployment**:
   - Clear your browser cache (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
   - Test the multiplayer functionality using these steps:

## Testing Multiplayer

1. **Create a Multiplayer Game**:
   - Open the app in your browser
   - Connect your wallet
   - Go to Blackjack or Minesweeper
   - Click "Create Game"
   - Copy the generated game link

2. **Join the Game**:
   - Open the game link in a different browser or incognito window
   - Connect a different wallet
   - The game should automatically connect you to the session
   - Take turns playing against yourself to verify multiplayer works

3. **Verify Real-time Updates**:
   - Make moves in one browser window
   - Verify the other window updates in real-time
   - Check that game state is preserved correctly

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. **Check Browser Console** for any Firebase errors
2. **Verify Both Players are Connected** to their wallets
3. **Use New Game Links** for each test (old links may expire)

## Firebase Rules

We've configured the Firebase database with the following rules to ensure security while allowing multiplayer functionality:

```json
{
  "rules": {
    "games": {
      ".read": "auth != null || true",
      ".write": "auth != null || true",
      "$gameType": {
        ".read": true,
        ".write": true,
        "$gameId": {
          ".read": true,
          ".write": true
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

These rules allow anyone to read and write to the games collection, which is necessary for the multiplayer functionality to work without requiring a backend server.
