# Deploy Your Rock Paper Solana App Now

## Fixed and Ready for Deployment!

We've made several improvements to ensure your app works perfectly:

1. **Fixed Styled Components**: Used the transient props pattern (prefixing props with `$`) to fix TypeScript errors
2. **Improved Wallet Integration**:
   - Added a more reliable Solana RPC endpoint using Helius
   - Fixed wallet connection functionality
   - Added balance refresh capability
   - Improved wallet dropdown menu

3. **Proper Provider Setup**:
   - Ensured WalletProvider is correctly set up in _app.tsx
   - Removed redundant provider in Layout.tsx

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix styled-components and wallet functionality"
git push
```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Import your GitHub repository
- Leave all settings at their defaults
- Click "Deploy"

## Testing After Deployment

After deployment, be sure to test:

1. **Wallet Connection**: The "Connect Wallet" button should work properly
2. **SOL Balance**: Your SOL balance should display correctly after connecting
3. **Dropdown Menu**: Click on your balance to see the dropdown with options

If you see any remaining issues, you can make additional changes and push to GitHub - Vercel will automatically redeploy.

## Sharing With Friends

Once deployed, Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

Share this URL with your friends to play together. The multiplayer and invitation features will work as long as both players can access the internet.
