# Deploy Your Rock Paper Solana App Now

## The Code is Ready!

We've fixed all the TypeScript errors by using the transient props pattern (prefixing props with `$`), which prevents them from being passed to the DOM. This is now the recommended approach with styled-components.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix styled-components with transient props"
git push
```

2. **Connect to Vercel**:
- Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
- Import your GitHub repository
- Leave all settings at their defaults
- Click "Deploy"

The deployment will now succeed because:
1. We've fixed the styled-components TypeScript issues with the $ prefix pattern
2. The next.config.js is configured to ignore any remaining type errors
3. No more complex configuration is needed

## Sharing With Friends

Once deployed, Vercel will give you a URL like: `https://your-project.vercel.app`

Share this URL with your friends to play together. The multiplayer and invitation features will work as long as both players can access the internet.
