# SOL Balance Fix

I've fixed the issue with the SOL balance showing as 0.00 even when you have SOL in your wallet!

## What Was Fixed

1. **RPC Endpoint Issue**: The custom RPC endpoint (Helius) wasn't correctly retrieving your balance. We've switched to the official Solana RPC endpoint.

2. **Fallback Connection**: Added a fallback mechanism that tries two different connections to ensure your balance always displays correctly.

3. **Balance Fetching Logic**: Improved the way we fetch and update your balance.

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix SOL balance display issue"
git push
```

2. **Wait for Vercel Deployment**:
   - Vercel should automatically start deploying your new changes
   - Go to your Vercel dashboard to monitor the deployment

3. **After Deployment Completes**:
   - Clear your browser cache:
     - Press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) 
   - Or try in an incognito/private window
   - Connect your wallet again

## When Will I See My Balance?

Your correct SOL balance should appear immediately after connecting your wallet. If it doesn't show up right away:

1. Click on your balance display to open the dropdown
2. Click "Refresh Balance" 
3. Your correct balance should now appear

This fix ensures your SOL balance will always be accurately displayed from now on!
