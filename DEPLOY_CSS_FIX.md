# CSS Styling Fix for Rock Paper Solana

We've fixed the CSS styling issues in your Rock Paper Solana application. The problem was related to how styled-components was being rendered on the server-side in production.

## What Was Fixed

1. **Added Server-Side Rendering for styled-components**
   - Created a custom `_document.tsx` file to collect and inject styled-components styles
   - Set up proper style extraction with ServerStyleSheet

2. **Added Babel Configuration**
   - Created a `babel.config.js` file for proper styled-components processing
   - Installed the babel-plugin-styled-components package

3. **Updated Next.js Configuration**
   - Enhanced the styled-components compiler options in next.config.js
   - Improved Content-Security-Policy to allow styles and fonts

4. **Fixed Global Styles**
   - Added GlobalStyle component in _app.tsx
   - Enhanced the CSS variables and theme

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the updated code to GitHub**:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix CSS styling with proper styled-components SSR"
git push
```

2. **Redeploy on Vercel**:
   - Vercel should automatically detect the changes and start a new deployment
   - If not, you can manually trigger a new deployment from the Vercel dashboard

3. **Clear Browser Cache**:
   - After deployment completes, press Ctrl+F5 (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) to force a complete reload
   - Or open the site in an incognito/private window

## Verifying the Fix

The website should now load with all styles properly applied:
- Proper colors and backgrounds
- Styled buttons and cards
- Font styles and spacing
- All UI components looking as designed

If you still see styling issues after deploying:

1. **Check Vercel Build Logs**:
   - Go to your project in the Vercel dashboard
   - View the build logs for any errors related to styled-components

2. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - In your Vercel project settings, add:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_STYLED_JSX=true`
